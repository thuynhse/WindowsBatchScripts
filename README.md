# WindowsBatchScripts
A repository where I explore windows batch scripting. <br/>

**My first script:** check_folder_if_empty.cmd<br/>
This script has 2 versions of function for checking either a specific folder is empty or not. Preferred I think it's the first version as it doesn't need to iterate the whole current folder. The script is also writing to a log.<br/>
Beware, the path in the script uses relative path; thus would needs modification of the path.<br/>
